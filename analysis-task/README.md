## Analysis task

This is where I analysed the snippet provided.

Please have a look at snippet.annotated.js to see my comments about the code,
snippet.refactored.js contains a possible approach to a refactor.

It was funny but a bit uncomfortable to refactor code without the help of tests, one
is always wondering "Did I forget something here?", so I've found myself working
in really small iterations, moving little portions of logic around, one at a time
to reduce to change of new bugs.
